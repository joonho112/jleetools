Description: A collection of versatile utility functions designed for statistical
    analysis, data manipulation, and programming tasks. These functions were initially
    developed by JoonHo Lee for personal use as part of his work and research records.
    However, they are now made publicly available for others who might find them
    useful. The package aims to streamline workflows, enhance reproducibility, and
    improve coding efficiency in R.
